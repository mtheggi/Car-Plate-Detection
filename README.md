# Car-Plate-Detection
GEN004 Project and this is how to use it : <br>
1-First of all, you should know that the program folder contains many things:
<br>
•	Three “.m” files with names 1- ‘Program_plate_detection’. 2-  ‘construct_dataset’ .3- ‘detectionFunction2’
<br>
•	One “. Mat” file with name ‘NewTemplates‘[ dataset of  our program which are letters and numbers]
<br>
•	Two subfolders. The first the first one contains a sample inputs or images to test the program, and the second one contains the data of alphabetics and numbers.<br> 
2-	you should open the file that has the main code with name ‘Program_plate_detection’.
<br>
3-	You should ensure that all files in the same directory and path to avoid errors while running 
<br>
4-	Select the editor window, and then click on button (Run) in the editor bar
<br>
5-	A user input box will appear, choose the image of interest
<br>
6-	Then, a binary image appears in figure in MATLAB. you should crop the car plate section, but make sure to select only white letters and numbers. Try as much as you can to make the background of the selected rectangle to be black to make sure that the program reads the right number of objects.
